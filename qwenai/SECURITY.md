## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities via email to:
- **Email**: security@example.com (replace with actual contact)
- **Subject**: [SECURITY] OpenAI-Compatible AI Integration - Vulnerability Report

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

1. **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
2. **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
3. **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
4. **Special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
5. **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
6. **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
7. **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of report
- **Triage**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity (see below)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

### Severity Levels

#### Critical (24-48 hours)
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Full system compromise

#### High (1 week)
- Privilege escalation
- Data exposure
- API key leakage

#### Medium (2-4 weeks)
- Denial of service
- Information disclosure
- Input validation issues

#### Low (4-8 weeks)
- Minor information leaks
- Configuration issues
- Rate limiting bypasses

## Security Best Practices for Users

### API Key Security
- **Never share** API keys in public repositories
- **Rotate keys** regularly
- **Use environment variables** or secrets management
- **Monitor usage** in provider dashboards

### Network Security
- **Use HTTPS** endpoints only
- **Validate certificates** (handled automatically)
- **Avoid public networks** for sensitive operations
- **Monitor network traffic** for anomalies

### Home Assistant Security
- **Keep HA updated** to latest version
- **Use strong passwords** for HA access
- **Enable two-factor authentication** when available
- **Review integration permissions** regularly

### Configuration Security
- **Limit API permissions** when possible
- **Use least privilege principle**
- **Review logs** for suspicious activity
- **Backup configurations** securely

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

#### API Key Protection
- No logging of API keys or credentials
- Secure transmission over HTTPS only
- Memory cleanup after use
- Format validation without exposure

#### URL Validation
- HTTPS enforcement for production
- Private network detection and warnings
- Malicious URL pattern blocking
- Certificate validation

#### Rate Limiting
- Exponential backoff for retry attempts
- Connection timeout protection
- Request throttling
- Error rate monitoring

#### Input Validation
- Strict parameter type checking
- JSON schema validation
- Length limits on inputs
- Sanitization of user data

### Security Headers
The integration sets appropriate security headers:
- `X-Title`: Identifies the application
- `HTTP-Referer`: Proper referrer information
- No sensitive data in headers
